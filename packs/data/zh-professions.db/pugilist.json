      "@en": "The Pugilist fights with his fists for money. Perhaps they were always a scrapper and joined a traveling circus, or they learned to fight in the army and found no other career, or they learned to fight protecting their family against the Bailiffs or they are just a rowdy drunk. Now they are able to win fights with their bare fists by strength of will and atrophy of nerve. A rare few make their living as prize fighters, living off hefty purses as prizes, while the washed-up end up in the back alleys fighting for a handful of pennies or as bouncers in lowly winesinks. Regulated matches leave the fighters looking only slightly better than pounded beef, while amateur bouts can end with one – or both – participants dead. Not to mention lingering pain, blackouts and confusion; pugilism is a sport where sacrifice is key.\nWhat does a Pugilist do though, when they can no longer, or no longer want to, fight? Aggression being their forte and their livelihood, the Pugilist finds it very challenging – nigh unto impossible – to sire and raise a family or improve their station to more gentile callings. They can no more change their nature than a bull in a china shop. Many a lover or child has fallen bloody prey to their own attempts to disprove this; truly, a grim end for even the mightiest of Pugilists. All that’s left is the fight, and the Pugilist is willing to bring it on until their own bitter end comes."
