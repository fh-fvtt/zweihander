      "@en": "A grim & perilous world is often fraught with communications errors. This is primarily due to the distances between settlements. Crucial information is lost or never makes its way to its intended source. Countless obstacles stand in the way of news and events – corrupt politicians, roving armies and long distances all provoke uncertainty. Enter the Messenger. Messengers are solely charged with making it their job to get information from place or person to another, on time. There are countless types of these couriers: some are town criers who warn of an impending attack (recall Paul Verehen’s warning that, “the redcloaks are coming!”), runners who ferry messages between underground citadels and officers of the law who mount fast stallions to deliver parcels and letters. Messengers are especially useful to imperial rulers, ferrying official laws and orders from the capitol to far-flung bastions or outposts, whether they be a simple commendation or new orders in a battle strategy. If roads are a nation’s veins, Messengers are its lifeblood.//nNeither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds, for that is the Messenger’s official motto. Messengers are cunning, spry and able to adapt to a change in circumstances at a moment’s notice. Sadly, that makes Messengers somewhat lacking in versatility – they just deliver messages, don’t directly influence policy or know how to read or write. This also makes them prime targets for enemies of all sorts – whether they be opposing armies or information-brokers, disrupting communication lines can easily cause an entire country to crumble if executed correctly. Messengers often develop paranoid delusions that their failure to deliver their message on time will have disastrous consequences. As long as they are wary of whatever lurks around each corner or beyond each hill, they will be safe. In reality though, they are just as vulnerable as us all."
