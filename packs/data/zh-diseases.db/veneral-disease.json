Its treatment sometimes involves using an iron catheter to insert mites and lice into the genitalia. Terribly embarrassing and potentially fatal, Venereal Disease can persist over a lifetime."

If they succeed at a (Standard +/-0%) Heal Test, you do not suffer the effects for the following week. You may only be treated in this manner once every 24 hours, no matter whether it is successful or not."
