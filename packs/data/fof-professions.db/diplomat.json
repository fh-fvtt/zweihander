      "@en": "<p>There has never been a problem that could not be solved through compromise, and as an emissary, I pride myself on being the hand that reaches across the aisle. When dealing with aggrieved parties who are entrenched in their opinions, it takes a particular knack to sail between the two sides and find common ground. In the current time we live in, violence cannot be the answer. While some may try to strike at their friends, we must work in the best interests of our kin.</p>\n<p>That being said, I sense there is a shift in the air. I watch with growing dismay over the tensions rising between the Loyalists, Rebels and other factions. There is no need for these groups to escalate the troubles, and there is no need for their side to try and play a zero-sum game. Sadly, I feel that these growing tensions are about to explode and destroy everything around it. As for me, I am the best equipped to try to ease these tensions, and I promise I will try my damnedest to ensure that no war comes to this world.</p>"
