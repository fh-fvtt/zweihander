      "@en": "<p>The roads are oftentimes long and treacherous. Though some are well-developed and link the major cities, most are hunting trails connecting smaller communities and homesteads. The world is vast, and it is impossible to ensure every traveler is safe&mdash;which is where I come in. Everyone needs to make a living during these tough times, but I just happen to make it off of the unfortunate souls who wander down the wrong bend. If you travel alone or with no guards, don&rsquo;t be surprised if I step out of a copse of trees and relieve you of your hard-earned cash.</p>\n<p>Life on the road is tough&mdash;I&rsquo;ve seen things, you know. Even though growing tensions have made my job a bit easier, the aggression and desperation I see on my marks&rsquo; faces disturb me. I&rsquo;ve also stumbled across unpleasant things in the wilds by the roads&mdash;things I cannot fully explain. I&rsquo;m no stranger to fending off wild animals or upstart brigands, but ghosts of the civil dead wander the countryside, too. Soon, it won&rsquo;t just be me who is stalking the roadways&mdash;and trust me, spirits aren&rsquo;t as generous as I am.</p>"
