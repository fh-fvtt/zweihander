      "@en": "<p>Without me, houses would not be built, ships would not be unloaded, bricks would not be made, none of the work a thriving settlement needs would get done! So many think I&rsquo;m nothing but a simpleminded, faceless worker in the crowd. My self-worth is hard-earned and not given to me on a platter, like those dandyish types. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if what I do takes only brawn and not brain. I am happy knowing that my determination and hard work earns me a living and supports my loved ones.</p>\n<p>I see and hear a lot, working and socializing in circles outside of polite society. Spending an evening in a coffeehouse laughing, swapping stories and drinking is the best way to pass the time. If I were honest with myself, it is during these revels that my mood darkens. Every day, word reaches me of rebellion, deep-rooted anger and whispers of things best left unsaid. The political reasons behind all the anger are readily apparent, but it is the other things I hear that puzzle me&mdash;ghost stories made flesh, ghouls who haunt the graveyards and shadows that plague dreams.</p>"
