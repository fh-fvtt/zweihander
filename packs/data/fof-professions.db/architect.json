      "@en": "<p>There is a symphonic perfection in planes, angles and arches. Some might write in prose or paint the world as they see it, but I create using the universal language most ancient: mathematics. With physics and engineering, I manifest form and function through the buildings I design. Math is God&rsquo;s language and using it, I design everlasting works. My structures are not just places to live, but places speaking the language of the heavens. It is with geometry and calculus that I become closer to God and the enlightenment of His work.</p>\n<p>Many likely do not understand me. My thoughts are lofty, looking to the heavens, not as an astronomer would, but to realize the gifts God has given humankind&mdash;the ability to create from their mind&rsquo;s eye. Even in the garden of this great world, however, something roils beneath the surface. The more I work in God&rsquo;s language&mdash;the more angles and planes and calculations I perform&mdash;the more I learn those dark, unnatural secrets that belie God&rsquo;s intention in the dark corners of this world.</p>"
