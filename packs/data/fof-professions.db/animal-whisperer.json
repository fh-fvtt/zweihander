      "@en": "<p>Some say they can read others like a book, while others proclaim they read nature. I, however, read animals. Scoff if you must, but I know how to speak with them, and animals know how to talk with me. We share a bond, a means that is intuitive. I can tell you when they are frightened, when they suffer and&mdash;more importantly&mdash;what they feel. And, before you ask: no, I was not raised by wolves. I run with all beasts, even human ones.</p>\n<p>I run with the bison. I hunt with the fox. I climb with the squirrel in the forest&rsquo;s green, leafy boughs. I respect them as equals, but I do not think for a moment that our understanding lets me control them. Nor can they control the change evident in the air. As I make my way through this wilderness, I learn from the rabbit something is wrong. My friend the pigeon tells me she has seen a shadow grow. Worse still, the salmon whispers of rot here. I talk with my brother turtle and sister snake, and both warn me. Their message is always the same: darkness is here.</p>"
