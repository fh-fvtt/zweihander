      "@en": "<p>Those cowardly sailors who dare to call themselves &lsquo;Jack Tar&rsquo; make me laugh. Like the Wampanoag Nation&rsquo;s storied ancestors, I hunt and chase my prey: the deadly and enormous leviathan of the sea. When I am in my longboat, harpoon in hand, I stare in death&rsquo;s face and grin. I have stared into the abyssal eyes of the whale and have struck them down. I live for the thrill, for the feats of strength and courage that each hunt requires. I am as dedicated to my code of honor as any knight on horseback ever was.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed the ocean&rsquo;s tides are changing in the lull between looking for new pods to hunt. Every day I pass Loyalist ships loaded with beasts for the west coast, spelling doom for all who live there. But even in the dark waters where giant squids dwell, I have seen odd things. I have come across entire pods of dead whales in the middle of the sea, floating belly-up in a sargasso of blood and ambergris. Even our crew can only take a whale or two at a time&mdash;whatever is killing them is a monster far more powerful than any whale I&rsquo;ve ever hooked.</p>"
