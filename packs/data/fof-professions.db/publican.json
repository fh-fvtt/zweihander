      "@en": "<p>Welcome one and all to my ordinary! I can get you anything you desire&mdash;a stiff draught of ale, a fine stew I just whipped up or maybe just a nice spot by the fire and a plug of our fine tobacco? Everyone can eat, drink and be merry in my establishment because I am the monarch and demand peace here. Travelers, merchants, lone wanderers&mdash;whoever needs rest and a full belly is more than welcome to sit awhile and tell their stories. You&rsquo;re in luck because I am not your typical Admiral of the Blue. I&rsquo;ve been around for a while, and I&rsquo;ve developed a reputation for friendly service and a convivial atmosphere.</p>\n<p>I have seen many changes in this pub&mdash;from wars to strange occurrences on the road, I have weathered it all. Many think of the small city taverns as the real ones, but mine is a true fortress of protection and sanctuary. I know trouble is brewing in the townships&mdash;some calling for rebellion and others want to stay the course. All I know is that if the fighting comes out here, my customers will be safe and taken care of no matter what.</p>"
