      "@en": "<p>I want more. Not more wealth. Not more power. But something else&mdash;something that gives my life meaning. As to what, I do not have an answer . . . yet. I search for it in books. I search for it by working with my hands. I spend time in the wild communing with nature in hopes of gaining insight on my path to follow. It seems at every turn I am thwarted, and I remain empty and confused to my very core. What do I aspire to be? Sadly that is the question I still cannot answer.</p>\n<p>For as long as I can remember, I have asked myself a question: Is there more? The life that I live is a good one, but not the one I feel destiny wants for me&mdash;has created for me since the earth was made. I search for it, but it is something that remains just out of my gras&mdash;taunting me like a child, laughing at my frustration. I have learned to see the world differently, and because of this, I know something is wrong. As is often the case with destiny, I do not know what stirs&mdash;yet this time, I feel, all will be revealed.</p>"
