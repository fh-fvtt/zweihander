If you intend to touch a foe’s trappings (such as a weapon or their armor), they must Resist with a successful Coordination Test or else their trapping temporarily gains the Ruined! Quality. If you keep your hand on the object for longer than three minutes, you can temporarily destroy the object. This spell has no Effect on trappings with the Castle-forged Quality or Artifacts and Relics. Once the Duration is up, objects affected by this spell return to their normal state."
