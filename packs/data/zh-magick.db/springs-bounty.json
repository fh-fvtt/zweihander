If used on a person or creature, they will certainly give birth to something, but not likely that which they’d intended. Abyssal fiends are acutely attuned to this Magick, oftentimes placing their illseed within the bellies of would-be mothers. Whether you disclose this to the person is up to you, but either way, you suffer 6 Corruption (as does the mother once they find out whose seed they carry in their belly)."

If used on a person or creature, it guarantees that natural conception will take place and produce at least one child if bred under normal conditions, at the appropriate time."
