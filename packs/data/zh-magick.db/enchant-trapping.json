Whenever you enchant the object, it grants +10% towards one relevant Primary Attribute. For instance, you can enchant a jaunty hat to grant a boon to Intelligence or a codpiece to grant a benefit to Combat. Perhaps you enchant a set of slippers to grant a boost to Agility or a pair of silken gloves to improve Brawn; it is your choice. Whatever you wish to enchant, the form must follow its function. Such objects may only bear one enchantment at a time. Furthermore, a person cannot wield more than one Enchanted Trapping at a time."
