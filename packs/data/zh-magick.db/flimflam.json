You must tell the person what you wish for them to do out loud. Although this action cannot be used to Damage themselves, it can be used to persuade someone to ignore you, give you the best bargain, look the other way, do something foolish or other critical commands that would benefit you. Once cast, the subject of this Magick carries out the action, but is unaware that they have been given instructions to do so and once done, forget what it was they were instructed to do. Unless proven otherwise, they will deny all knowledge of the action and believe themselves to be innocent of it. The action they are instructed to do must take two minutes or less to complete."
