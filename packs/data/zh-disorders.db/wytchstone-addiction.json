      "@en": "Though the trading of Wytchstone is an everyday facet of the Great Warren’s shadow economy, Wytchstone-laced drugs have made their way to the surface to appear among the realms of humanity. Every time that a drug synthesized from Wytchstone is taken, the chance for addiction to this Corruptive substance grows. Waking dream-like states arrest the addict, as they find themselves tripping after ‘dropping a tab or a ring’, turning towards the sun or other strong sources of light to experience the strangeness of Wytchstone. Within the light, lucid images and strange colors arise, coalescing into the mysterious gestalt-like Daemon of the Skrzzak. These acid-fueled visions prognosticate of a bright yet doomed future. For Skrzzak, this addiction wears away at their Dark Sense, causing ‘dark blindness’. For others, it can bring about glaucoma... or worse."
