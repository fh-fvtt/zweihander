      "@en": "In a grim & perilous world, there are a multitude of horrors waiting at the periphery. From beasts born of the Abyss, to the corruptive ways of Orx and secretive political death cults, these threats loom both small in the darkness and large in the light. Though adventurers grow to be more resilient to the influence of these evils over time, in their quiet moments, these stressors transform into dread in otherwise innocuous situations. Fear of the supernatural rising from their grave may transform into fear of dirt, spiders or cobwebs. Fear of chaotic Magicks may turn into extreme discomfort while around practitioners of medicine (seen as sorcerous in some people’s eyes). Months of slaying mewling herds of Mutants may lead to fear of being around normal children crying. Even more innocuous of objects – sharp knives, being alone in a crowd, fear of drowning or far, far worse can emerge as fears from an adventurer’s turmoil. Either way, there is always one key object that someone with this Disorder is afraid of and avoidance of it is paramount to maintain their sanity."
