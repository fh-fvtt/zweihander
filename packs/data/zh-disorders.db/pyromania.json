      "@en": "Driven to the point where life means nothing but pain and darkness, a tiny spark of light brings sublime joy to a pyromaniac. Watching a dancing flame upon the end of a match reveals the beauty of the universe, contained within the fire. Only within that flame can the world be made whole again... by burning down the old and rebuilding from the ground up. Terrible Injuries stokes the flames from within, causing them to set fires. The flames and heat bring a sense of elation that lifts their spirits. The larger and more vigorous the flames, the greater sense of arousal. This incendiary urge drives them to have utter disregard for the safety of others around them, as only the blaze can truly bring them peace. But when the flames die down, a firebug will fall into a deep pit of nervousness and depression... at least, until they set their next blaze."
