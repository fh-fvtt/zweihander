      "@en": "To some, alcoholism is a disease. It can be treated with medicinal remedies and kinship with others in remission. But for you, it is madness itself. It is not that you’re immediately brought to the bottle every morning to function, so much as you drink to make the visions and voices in your head go away. What these visions are is up to you and what you have experienced; likely, a haunted memory of some terrible atrocity you’ve committed or were borne witness to. Perhaps the booze helps cloud the incessant buzzing of a hundred fold voices from the darkest corners of your mind. Either way, not a good place to be."
