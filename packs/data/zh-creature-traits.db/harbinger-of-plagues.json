When they play the gong with Litany of Hatred, Characters so affected also suffer 1D10+1 physical Peril. When they play the chime with Litany of Hatred, Characters so affected instead lower their Damage and Peril Condition Tracks by -3 instead. These trappings can only be used by hands of these creatures who bear them, otherwise useless relics."
