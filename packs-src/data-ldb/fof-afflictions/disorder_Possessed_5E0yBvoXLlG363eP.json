While Possessed, temporarily increase all your Primary Attributes by +9%. You can attempt to escape being Possessed every twenty-four hours. After breaking free, you are Incapacitated! and Unconscious for one hour. However, the Affliction remains until exorcised.</p>\n<p>Unlike other Afflictions, you should keep Possessed secret from other players. Being Possessed can mean different things, as Abyssal and Supernatural threats have their own agendas to enact. Work with the Historian to understand how this may impact your character. While temporarily Possessed, it will never be of benefit to your character&rsquo;s friends.</p>"
