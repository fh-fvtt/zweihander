      "@en": "<p>A terrible pox, the Chaotic Rot is inflicted upon innocent souls indiscriminately. It is considered to be one of the Abyssal Prince of Decay’s greatest works, a terrible contagion spread by powerfully malign mutants. Characterized by bouts of forgetfulness that escalate into total memory loss, this ailment slowly rots the brain from the inside out. It is the most rapacious of all diseases, one that not only eats the brain, but also eats at the soul. As the disease takes hold, the afflicted often either attempt to take their own lives to end the pain or seek succor from dark gods to lift this terrible sickness from them. Those who follow such a corrupted path risk a fate far worse than death.</p>"
