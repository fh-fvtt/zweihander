As the skin disease takes hold over its victim, horn-like, warty lesions develop upon a person’s limbs, strangely resembling tree bark. It viciously petrifies a victim’s hands and feet, until they become immobile like an ossified tree... until finally becoming one with the Black Lodge. Transformation into ‘the other’ is complete!</p>"
