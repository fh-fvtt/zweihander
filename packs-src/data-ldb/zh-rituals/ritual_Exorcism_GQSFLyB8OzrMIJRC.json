During this time, you must announce at least one Call Name (if a Lower Demon) or the True Name (if a Higher Demon or Restless Spirit) in order to Exorcise it. Roll 3D6 Chaos Dice (and add an additional 1D6 Chaos Die for every Call Name you know) for every hour you attempt to Exorcise the demon or spirit in this fashion:</p><ul><li><p>Should all three dice or more land on face ‘6’ (666), a Lower Demon, Higher Demon or Restless Spirit is immediately exorcised and will not possess that abode, host or object ever again.</p></li><li><p>Should two dice land on face ‘6’ (66), a Lower Demon or Restless Spirit is immediately exorcised and will not possess that abode, host or object ever again.</p></li><li><p>Should one die land on face ‘6’ (6), a Restless Spirit is immediately exorcised and will not possess that abode, host or object ever again.</p></li></ul></li></ul><p>Once a demon or spirit has been exorcised, it cannot possess another abode, host or object for one year. However, at the end of the Exorcise ritual, the exorcist must attempt a Secret Test using their Resolve Skill, with the Difficulty Rating determined by the GM. If successful, the exorcist can never be Possessed by the demon or spirit they just Exorcised. A Critical Success causes the demon or spirit to be instantaneously banished from the Material Realm (as the Greater Magick spell of Banishment from the Grimoire chapter of <strong>ZWEIHÄNDER</strong>). Both Failure and Critical Failure means that the exorcist suffers 6 Corruption, while Critical Failure also results in the exorcist gains the Disorder of <em>@UUID[Compendium.zweihander.zh-disorders.Item.5wBQjKkGTpWXyq5o]{Possessed!}</em>.</p>"
