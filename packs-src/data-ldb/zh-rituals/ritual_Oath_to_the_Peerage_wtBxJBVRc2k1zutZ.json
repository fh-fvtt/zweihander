As a pledge, they can now ‘tap’ into their Alignment by spending a Fortune Point. Pledges of Dominion may tap into their Order or Aspect Alignment, whereas pledges of Sovereignty may tap into their Chaos Alignment.</p><p>By ‘tapping’ into their Alignment, they may automatically succeed at the next, immediate Skill Test they make by spending a Fortune Point. However, the Skill Test must be appropriate to the situation. For example, a Character may have the Chaos Alignment of Mayhem. They are engaged in a back-and-forth with a merchant aggressively haggling over the price of an item they wish to purchase (an Intimidate Test). A player cannot simply state, “I tap into my character’s Alignment of Mayhem to get an advantage.” Instead, they should justify from a role-playing perspective how Mayhem comes into play in-game. Perhaps they describe that their Character begins flipping over tables, scattering the merchant’s goods, effectively intimidating the merchant until he capitulates to their demands. Another way would be to draw their sword, and act erratically to convince the merchant to acquiesce, if only to save the merchant’s own hide. The GM has the final say, however. You can find additional clarification under Alignment in the Character Creation chapter of <strong>ZWEIHÄNDER</strong>.</p>"
