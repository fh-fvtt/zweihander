      "@en": "Oftentimes confused with its brigandine cousin, ringmail armor is nothing less than a poor manâ€™s version of mail armor. Made from interlocking rings woven into a flexible coat of leather, ringmail is a common form of armor worn by rebels and highwaymen alike. Cheap and affordable, many a bitpenny-pinching baron has foisted this conciliatory form of armor upon his militia."
