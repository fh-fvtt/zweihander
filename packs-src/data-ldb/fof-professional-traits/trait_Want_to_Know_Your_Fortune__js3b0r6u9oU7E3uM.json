If you succeed, they gain a Coin for personal use only. If you Critically Succeed, they gain two Coins instead. Once the Coins are spent, they are discarded, not placed into the Coin pools. This benefit must be spent before they have their fortune told again. Randomly determine three Common Spells you learn as free Unique Abilities from the Common Spells Listings table. Finally, you can Risk Backlash and Unfetter your Spells (covered in <strong>Article 7: Combat Encounters</strong> and <strong>Article 9: Hexenmeister&rsquo;s Almanack</strong>).</p>"
