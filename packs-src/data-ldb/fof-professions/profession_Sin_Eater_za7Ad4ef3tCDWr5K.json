      "@en": "<p>Humankind is born into sin&mdash;there is no such thing as innocence. Many claim children are born without sin, but all humanity is cursed with a dark soul ever since our fall from grace. We are all bound for the eternal fires of hell unless we pray and make reparations, and I can aid in the process. I sacrifice my soul, eating the faults of all sinners to free them from eternal torment. When I absorb their misdeeds, they are with me forever&mdash;I can recall them with clarity, and I must account for them at the hour of my judgment. I know I have damned myself, but it is for love of this world that I do it, so I gladly accept.</p>\n<p>Evil has existed since the world was young, but as of late, it has grown with a fetid stink that may soon blossom out of control. This is undiluted sin, an evil waiting for a dark heart to do its bidding. Every sin we commit opens the well wider until we drown in the dark river of this evil. This malevolence can think and feel and hate, and it wants nothing more than to flood the world with its pitch-dark vileness. This makes my mission even more important.</p>"
