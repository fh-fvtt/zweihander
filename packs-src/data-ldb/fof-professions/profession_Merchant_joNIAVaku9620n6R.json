      "@en": "<p>There are many ways to make money, but I can turn my own money into even more income. I risk my capital to buy and sell wares &amp; weapons in a speculative way, selling them when the market demands. I have bankrolled expeditions east for new and exotic products, funded businesses that turn into profit creators themselves, and I am not above using some golden grease to convince officials to look the other way. Goods move in and out of the country, and I sit in the middle of it all&mdash;wealth revolving around me like the moon round the sun.</p>\n<p>I might not let on, but current tensions have me worried. The anger will do nothing but make my job harder. I only need to look at the Intolerable Acts and the continued taxation to see my fears are valid and my bottom line is ever increasing. Both sides of this argument have merit, but no matter which side I choose, both my businesses and I will lose out&mdash;maybe permanently. The only solution I see is pitting both sides against each other, but that is a game not many walk away from.</p>"
