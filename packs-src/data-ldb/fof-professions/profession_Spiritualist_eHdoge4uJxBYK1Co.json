      "@en": "<p>My skills are not of this world, as I possess the gift of sight beyond sight. Spirits exist everywhere, and I see them regularly. There are the spirits of animals and plants, spirits of the wind and an infinite number of others. I pay reverence to these invisible forces because I can commune with them&mdash;and they, in turn, interact with me. Most spirits are benevolent, natural parts of our world, but there are also dark spirits&mdash;specters of the dead, or even creatures that some call demons or devils. It may not be comforting to think so, but these dark spirits are just as natural to our world as the others.</p>\n<p>It is hard to ignore the troubles plaguing our world right now. I do not need the printed word to keep informed, as the trees and rocks whisper to me of the coming conflict. Maybe both sides have valid points, but there are bigger issues brewing. The dark spirits I see are growing in number, and some have even managed to cross the veil into our reality. The spirits tell of a dark shadow they refuse to name, and this fact alone chills me to my marrow.</p>"
