      "@en": "<p>As a Boatswain (pronounced BOH-sn), two things make me happy. The first is life upon the water. The second is a well-ordered dock. Though many might think there is no glamour in what I do, they would be wrong. I bring order to the chaos that is life at sea. The waters are the lifeblood of the world&rsquo;s empires, and it is people like me who keep towns and settlements well supplied. Without me, no one working the deck would know their role, nor would the ship be able to function, nor would the world even function properly.</p>\n<p>Though I might appear to be skilled at producing order out of chaos, I harbor a secret: there is no order, only chaos. The things I have seen while sailing have shaken me to the very core. Things lurk within the water and dance in cresting waves while the storms surge. I&rsquo;ve seen good people plunge overboard, searching for a mermaid I myself was not entirely convinced wasn&rsquo;t real. There is another form of chaos brewing as well. But, between the blaring of the foghorn and the drums of war, an elder evil silently creeps into our world.</p>"
