      "@en": "<p>Printing is the one thing that binds us, and in these troubled times, it is one of the most important occupations. I am how people stay informed in the cities. Pamphlets, broadsheets, newsletters, books both sacred and secular&mdash;with my press and movable type, I can create it all. My work has inspired people to unite, to rebel, to learn and to find salvation. Few others can make such a claim, but my ink-stained hands and my sore shoulder muscles are proof. No matter who writes the copy, I will make it available to everyone willing to read it.</p>\n<p>Now more than ever, these skills I command are needed. The escalating tensions between Rebels and Loyalists have made Printers indispensable. I publish the words of the people on both sides and pass it along to the common folk. More concerning, however, are some of the jobs I have taken recently&mdash;dark texts and pamphlets warning of something coming besides the inevitable war. It concerns me greatly, but who am I to deny them their right to speech?</p>"
