      "@en": "<p>Every house you see, every ship you board, each canoe traversing the river, every barrel you store pickles in&mdash;you have us to thank for that. My work is indispensable, as I provide roofs over peoples&rsquo; heads and places to keep their food. Using simple tools and wood from humble trees, I can build nearly anything. Not only that, my handiwork and care make these mundane objects into beautiful pieces of art people are proud to use. I have plenty of splinters and calluses to show for all my hard work, but I can rest easy at night knowing I finished a job well done.</p>\n<p>My orders for all sorts of items have increased tenfold in the past few months: wheels for cannons, stocks for guns, jolly boats for ships. Only a fool would deny that war is on the horizon, and my work will serve as a lynchpin in the conflict. I have heard both sides of the debate, and while I have my own opinions, my mind is firmly focused on my work. Violence will undoubtedly strike very soon, and I need to be prepared no matter who contracts me for work. And if I have to fight to defend myself, I have plenty of ways to build weapons as well.</p>"
