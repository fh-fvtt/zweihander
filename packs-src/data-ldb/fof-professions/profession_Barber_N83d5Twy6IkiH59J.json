      "@en": "<p>Humankind is the perfect machine, and in that same vein, I could be called the body&rsquo;s carpenter. I wake up early every morning and here in my shop I prepare for the day. Ah, what a life, what a pleasure for a Barber of my quality! I am ready for anything, night and day&mdash;a nobler life cannot be found. With razors, combs, lancets and scissors at my command, I am ready for everyone who asks for me. Here are my wigs for powdering, my razor for shaving, leeches for bleeding&mdash;I mend and groom and send my clients on their way.</p>\n<p>I am a Barber, quick with the razor, quick with setting a broken bone, quick with whatever ails a person. Young and old, sick or well, I do not care&mdash;they are all the same. This war may come, or it may not, but I will stand stalwart as I always have. Everyone needs my services, and my work cares not for what someone believes or to whom they pledge loyalty. Though, if I were honest, there is something peculiar afoot that sometimes chills my spine. I see it in the eyes of those who come for my services. What this is, I hope never to find out.</p>"
