      "@en": "<p>Everyone on the frontier needs to know how to stalk, track and hunt, but my skills are honed to a level that makes me stand out amongst my fellows. I know how to read the world around me either through reading or from the histories passed down to us. I study tracks, examine spoor or refuse and have even wandered into places no settler has. I track not only animals but also people&mdash;who are probably the cruelest of all creatures. There is no one I haven&rsquo;t been able to track down, thanks to my many years of experience.</p>\n<p>As the hunting paths and roads become more dangerous due to the rising conflict, my work is in higher demand. People trust only me to tread the paths that terrify others, to search out where potential enemies or targets may hide. This is the easiest part of my job, and I sense my most difficult quarries are coming soon. I&rsquo;ve seen signs of dark entities on my journeys&mdash;things that have in the past only been whispered to children to scare them. If this so-called shadow grows any more, I pray that I have the strength to face it head-on.</p>"
