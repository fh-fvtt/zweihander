      "@en": "<p>The Intolerable Acts? Please, when it comes to smuggling, they may as well be called the Tolerable Acts! Ports are closed and taxes are through the roof, but that just means more business for me. I&rsquo;ve spent enough years running blockades, hiding contraband and greasing the palms of dockworkers to know this will pass&mdash;but while it&rsquo;s here, why not take advantage? No job is too big or too small for me as long as the price is right. After all, the wheels of commerce still have to turn, even if we are at war.</p>\n<p>There will be war, too, make no mistake&mdash;but I couldn&rsquo;t care less. Rebels and Loyalists need contraband goods no matter what flag they live under, so whoever wins won&rsquo;t affect my margins in the least. War brings more profits and opportunities to my business, so the longer the conflict lasts, the better, I say. I&rsquo;m not a mercenary or a warmonger&mdash;I&rsquo;m just an honest business owner trying to make a few pounds sterling in a less than the conventional way. I&rsquo;m certain there will come a time when I have to make a decision as to where my allegiances rest.</p>"
