      "@en": "<p>Gambling is obviously not the purest of career choices, but the people who say that are just jealous of the life I lead. I laugh at those fools, toiling away in the fields or hauling cargo at the dock for meager pay. Let the foolhardy attempt to carve out life along the unpredictable frontier&mdash;I am not made for that. I thrive in the ordinaries (taverns) and coffee houses, depending on my wits and charm to earn my place in the world. Whether I study the history of the four kings, dice or games of drink, I am a master of hazards and chance. Well, I also have help from Divine Providence&mdash;whose luck and good fortune shines upon me.</p>\n<p>Trouble is here, and I feel in my bones that my good luck may have run its course. I have seen this trouble brewing, even been caught up in it at times. The docks teem with anger toward the Loyalists&rsquo; actions; the ordinaries foment anger toward everybody else. Meanwhile, I sense a growing threat deep in the shadows that wants to destroy it all. No matter who spills the first blood, fortune is a fickle mistress, and we are all at the mercy of Divine Providence.</p>"
