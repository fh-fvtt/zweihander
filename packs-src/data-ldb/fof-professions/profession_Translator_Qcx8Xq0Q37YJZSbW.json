      "@en": "<p>As more and more people migrate and immigrate, my job as a Translator becomes all the more critical. I am a master of languages, from Portuguese to French to Spanish to Indigenous dialects. I serve as a mediator for business and political endeavors. I&rsquo;ve also had experience translating tongues long forgotten, tomes that contain mysteries pertaining to cultural advancement and religious study. Most people only know one or two languages, whereas my studies have made me a true polyglot.</p>\n<p>My skills are always in demand, and I am happy to provide them&mdash;for a price, of course. Lately, these skills have been put to even greater use by the various councils and politicians. Interestingly, I have been contracted by people who have more bizarre or erudite tastes. As more and more ancient texts and tomes pass into my hands, I become increasingly concerned. At first, I approached these books as tests of my skills, but each of their pages warns of people called the Mandoag. Could this pattern be a fluke, or is there merit to the words?</p>"
