      "@en": "<p>People won&rsquo;t admit it openly, but everyone needs smuggled wares &amp; weapons or illegal commodities they can&rsquo;t get. I provide a similar service, but my business involves exhuming the dead instead of running blockades. I&rsquo;ve been asked to steal odd things from graves, even dead bodies. What people want with them, I never ask. They can eat the damned bones for all I care; as long as they pay me, I will happily march into the damn graveyard with a shovel in hand.</p>\n<p>All go to the diet of the worms, and the fields of the dead are a frightening place during the daylight, but even worse at night with risk of capture. I&rsquo;ve been doing this a long time, and I&rsquo;ve seen odd things in these graveyards: creatures half-formed, illuminated by the crescent moon, strange robed figures entering mausoleums and clawing noises from deep inside the earth. At the bottom of my heart, I know that one day this job will be the death of me&mdash;I just hope my death comes at the end of a hangman&rsquo;s noose and not one of those nightcrawlers who haunt my reality.</p>"
