      "@en": "<p>Life is precious. It is to be cherished and, above all, protected. With each newborn child that I usher into this world, I welcome another wondrous soul to our community. I know how to ease the pain and ensure life, not death, comes from birth. It is I, and I alone, who brings comfort to parents and children. I am the doctor when your life is at risk, the nursemaid to your baby and the gentle comfort when the worst happens. It is my sacred duty.</p>\n<p>I have ushered many new lives into this world, which brings me great joy. More than anything, it fills me with a purpose far more significant than most understand. This understanding tells me something is spiritually amiss in our world, far greater than the war. I feel this wrongness deep within my bones. I hear it in the cries of dying infants and see it in the unearthly hollowness in parents&rsquo; eyes. Infants die and stillbirths grow even more common. Shadows and darkness lurk within the sacred moments of birth. There are eyes in those shadows, watching and waiting to snuff away these precious gifts of life. I am fearful of what is to come.</p>"
