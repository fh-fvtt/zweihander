      "@en": "<p>I am fervently religious and hold deep beliefs, far more profound than even my local preacher. Some claim to channel the power of God and work miracles in His name, but I have truly learned these mysteries. The Bible is only a fraction of God&rsquo;s word&mdash;the Romanus- Buchlein, Egyptian Secrets of Albertus Magnus and the Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses have opened the divine path to me! I know God&rsquo;s true whims and meaning, and because of this, He has chosen to grant me the boon of performing miracles. Ministers have long tried to hide the truth but have failed in their endeavors to hide it from me.</p>\n<p>Many see me as deluded or even evil, saying my claim of this power is asinine at best and heretical at worst. Yet, I know the truth. The word of God&mdash;which is codified and written by the Prophet of Moses&mdash;gives one who is willing to read and learn the means of communing with God. I do not lie when I say I have spoken with God, and my powers are proof. But perhaps worse, God has warned me of a great coming calamity, second only to Judgment Day.</p>"
