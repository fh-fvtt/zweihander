      "@en": "<p>Loneliness haunts this world, as it always has. It isn&rsquo;t desperation that drives people to me. It&rsquo;s the need for tenderness and companionship, the need to feel cared for in a world too cold to be safe. My lips hold the promise of release and of silence. I am one of the greatest keepers of secrets. For every need in the city, there is someone who can provide. I meet them without flinching, for no desire is too strange, no hunger too consuming and no lust too overwhelming. But in these times, it is all a means to an end as secrets are sold for pounds sterling.</p>\n<p>My delicious skills have put me in touch with people from all parts of society. Rich or poor, prominent or unknown, I give them the comfort they seek. Secrets always spill forth from between lovers&rsquo; lips. Some deal with the coming conflict while others are of darker origin. I know how to whisper those secrets into the right ear, for the right price. Some private affairs, however, are particularly troubling. I suppose the secrets of the coming war are inconsequential when there&rsquo;s something else stalking all of us out there.</p>"
