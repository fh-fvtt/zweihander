      "@en": "<p>Bankers may have the money, merchants may make the money, but only I know how to hide the money. Without me, no one knows where anything is. That shipment of tea? That &lsquo;arrived&rsquo; last week and &lsquo;sold&rsquo; yesterday. The truth is that it arrived a month ago and I sold it for twice the asking price&mdash;netting myself a tidy profit. This is not to say that I am a thief. Still, with one stroke of my pen I can make a merchant&rsquo;s wealth disappear or improve fortunes of the deserving. In truth, I am just an upstanding person who does what I love: keeping and fixing the books to my pleasure.</p>\n<p>In the booming ports along the coast, business grows. Money is made, deals are struck and debts are called in. What I do might not be the most dangerous job; after all, I record in ledgers and the only risk to my health is an ink spill or a papercut. Yet, things are changing. Dimly along the horizon, I see clouds gather as a storm brews. Soon the lightning will strike, and the peace will be shattered, and my books will do little good then.</p>"
