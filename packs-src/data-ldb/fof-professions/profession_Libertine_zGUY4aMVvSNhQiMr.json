      "@en": "<p>We are on this earth for such a short time&mdash;why should I not attempt to get as much out of it as I can? It does not matter what I indulge in: pleasures of the flesh, impish delights or potent stuff&mdash;just as long as it is enjoyable, I shall engage in it to the fullest. It doesn&rsquo;t mean I lack morals or decency. I would say I&rsquo;m more moral than most people who walk around with their noses high in the air. I simply ignore those urges of responsibility or duty to enjoy the bounty of life. After all, what purpose does life hold if it is not to be enjoyed to the utmost?</p>\n<p>Just because I enjoy everything in this life doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m an addlepate without the ability to be serious or notice what is happening all around us. True, I sometimes hide my thoughts behind a facade, but it is no mystery that I worry about the change that is coming. There shall be war, and there shall be dust and blood, but through it all, I am determined to enjoy life&mdash;to do otherwise would spell despair and disgust. The time may come where I feel guilty for downing a celebratory drink, but at least for now, another round!</p>"
