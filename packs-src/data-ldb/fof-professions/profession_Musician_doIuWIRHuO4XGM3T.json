      "@en": "<p>Music is the key to life. It is essential to celebrate all the world&rsquo;s wonders, from the first note of birth to the final chord of death. Through music, I rejoice in the beauty around me, as well as the beauty inside everyone. Music comes in many forms, from a dirge to a sonata to a waltz, played on a harp, fiddle, fife or any instrument I can get my hands on. Music isn&rsquo;t merely playing what you feel, though that is a significant component. No, there is a mathematical order to music that few see, and those who know to look for it realize that the universe moves in a beautiful 4/4 time.</p>\n<p>I seem useless on the battlefield, but what better time to enjoy music than in the throes of war? Bombastic celebrations of victory and pensive opuses on mortality all soothe us during these times. War is looming, and no matter how much I hope they would, music and jubilation cannot solve every problem. That will not stop me from composing and playing, however, as a song in one&rsquo;s heart is the greatest defense against the sorrows and pains of conflict.</p>"
