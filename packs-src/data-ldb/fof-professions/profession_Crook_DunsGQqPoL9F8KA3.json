      "@en": "<p>Everyone needs to make a living. Some might choose to do it honestly&mdash;after all, the world needs its deckhands, ditch diggers and laborers. That requires backbreaking work, though, and I&rsquo;m not in favor of such hard labor. I prefer a more subtle approach to make my living, and that&rsquo;s by robbery. Some people are shocked I&rsquo;m so willing to admit it so plainly, but if people didn&rsquo;t want their possessions stolen, they would lock their doors and shutters. Let&rsquo;s face it: I am teaching people a lesson in both security and appreciation. As a great philosopher once said, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what you got &rsquo;til it&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>I am not a bad person, really&mdash;I just don&rsquo;t have a problem with performing tasks others find dubious. I have missed being stabbed by the Bridport dagger many times. At least I&rsquo;m honest with myself, unlike most people. Now there&rsquo;s a chance to earn more loot with the coming war&mdash;as people flee their homes. A workday simply involves walking into these hovels and taking anything not nailed down. I don&rsquo;t really care which side is right, or even which side wins, as I&rsquo;m happy to plunder from Loyalists and Rebels equally.</p>"
