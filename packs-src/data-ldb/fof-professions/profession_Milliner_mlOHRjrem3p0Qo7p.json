      "@en": "<p>I am an artisan, and my fellow artisans and I take pride in the works of art we create every day. My specialty is the humble hat, which is so much more than a head covering. There is purity and honor in working with ones&rsquo; hands to create something that people need. You may think a hat is a plebian item, but all manner of folk wear them upon their heads. I know deep within my soul that the crafting of a hat is a pure art form. Stone, tin and gold are of course beautiful mediums, but there is a subtle grace in the art of felt and leather.</p>\n<p>Like many, it is hard for me not to notice the rising tensions. These tensions are amongst my fellow Milliners, as well as between the Loyalists and Rebels. I really do not know what to think about all of this, and I&rsquo;m not sure if I should have an opinion. My craft involves no bloodshed, save a few pricked fingers, and swears no fealty to any side, but I will lose business whichever way this conflict goes. I worry most for the small crafters such as myself who are caught in the middle of a mess that none of us asked for.</p>"
