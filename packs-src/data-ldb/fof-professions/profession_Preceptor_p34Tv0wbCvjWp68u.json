      "@en": "<p>Let me teach your child about the ways of the world, filled with discoveries and wonder. These enlightened times bring new perspectives to old thoughts and beliefs. Gone are the days of relying on superstition and myth. Now is the age of fact: of discovery, knowledge and natural philosophy. I do not teach the antiquated ways; I am a disciple of modernity. This new knowledge is necessary for your children to thrive as they grow to adulthood. I am the one who will guide your children through the ways of the world, an intellectual parent when you cannot be. I will shape your child into someone capable of navigating the world with an eye for modernity.</p>\n<p>However, what I do not speak about outside of private company is that I also teach the secret truths of the world. When the shades are drawn, you and I shall conspire by the fireside, discoursing upon the secret calculus that allows us to open new vistas hidden from view. I&rsquo;ve learned that this darkness has a name, but what it intends, I do not know. Fear it, for to doubt it is to be disarmed.</p>"
