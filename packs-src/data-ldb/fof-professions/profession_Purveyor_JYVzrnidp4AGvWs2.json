      "@en": "<p>When a laborer comes back from an honest day&rsquo;s work, they just want to take their boots off, kick their feet up and have a nice pot of coffee. But where do they get the excellent pair of boots, a sturdy footrest, the coffee beans and a pot? All from me, of course: the humble Purveyor. Alongside the Greengrocer, I bring the comforts of modern life to all my customers, and all I require in exchange is a thank-you and a few coins deposited into my coffer.</p>\n<p>As a plyer, I come into contact with all types of people. Each one has different opinions, and all this discord is what&rsquo;s driving the tensions currently spreading throughout the Colonies. There is no denying trouble is brewing and war shall soon darken our doorstep again. Trade for the small luxuries I stock all but dries up during those lean times, and I may have to resort to selling hunting rifles or hastily made bandages. It won&rsquo;t be my first time as a wartime peddler, but it never gets easier seeing the desperation and fear on the faces of my customers, who used to greet me with a smile and a friendly chat.</p>"
