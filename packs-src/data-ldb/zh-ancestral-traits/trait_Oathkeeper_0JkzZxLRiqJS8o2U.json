They jealously guard the secrets of their work, passing these ancient rituals to their children. But as their fingers are the size of blood sausages and calloused, most Dwarves find it difficult to work with things smaller than their hands. A rare few possess this gift, unlikely to share its secrets with others outside of their clan."
