Should you share Dwarven heritage, you may have a mercurial disposition. If sharing Elven heritage, you may fly into fey rages when things don’t go your way. If sharing Gnome heritage, you may like to break things apart in hopes of learning how they work. If sharing Halfling heritage, you may exhibit an insatiable appetite for larceny. Finally, if sharing Ogre heritage, you may possess a predilection towards eating every morsel you can get your grubby mitts on.<br/>Randomly generate your Mixed Bloodline by rolling D100, consulting the Ancestral table on Step III: Sex & Ancestry. As a result, you may randomly determine another Ancestral Trait outside of the Human’s Mixed Bloodline. Once determined, go to the first page of the Character sheet and record your Mixed Bloodline under Background and record your new Ancestral Trait."
