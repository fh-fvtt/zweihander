If the charcoal is thrown into any new fire, you conjure forth an illusion of anything you can imagine, guaranteeing it&rsquo;s smaller than an oxen. It has no physical tangibility, nor emits a smell, sound or taste. Anyone who sees the illusion can attempt to see through it with a successful Secret Test using Awareness. Once the duration is over, the charcoal is destroyed. This Spell requires Concentration.</p>"
