Call out the foe&rsquo;s name you wish to torment, and prick the doll with a pin as they move one, two or three steps down the Peril Condition Tracks negatively (your choice). Hold it over a fire, and they suffer from Mildly, Moderately or Seriously Dangerous Fire (your choice). Tie the doll&rsquo;s legs together, and the foe is paralyzed for twenty-four hours. Tie the doll&rsquo;s hands together, and the foe is unable to use their arms for twenty-four hours. Sew the mouth of the doll shut, and the foe is unable to speak for twenty-four hours. Bury it into the earth, and the foe temporarily reduces all of their Primary Attribute Bonuses by -9. If the doll isn&rsquo;t used within a week or is destroyed by fire, the Spell ends. Each time you use the doll, you move one step down the Peril Condition Track and gain 3 Conflict. This Spell requires Concentration.</p>"
