When you generate face ‘6’ with Chaos Dice, you invoke a Chaos Manifestation. Furthermore, you must add 1 additional Chaos Die when Channeling Power. Finally, whenever you are Incapacitated!, you cannot recover your Peril Condition Track under any circumstance until you indulge in a vice first. Suggestions include blasphemy, gambling, intoxication, prostitution and self-harm.</p>"
