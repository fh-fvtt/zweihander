When you generate face ‘6’ with Chaos Dice, you invoke a Chaos Manifestation. Furthermore, you must add 1 additional Chaos Die when Channeling Power. Finally, whenever you gain 1 permanent Chaos Rank, a Disorder or Malignancy, you also permanently suffer a -1 penalty to Movement. Should your Movement permanently reach zero, you are immediately Slain!, turned entirely to stone.</p>"
