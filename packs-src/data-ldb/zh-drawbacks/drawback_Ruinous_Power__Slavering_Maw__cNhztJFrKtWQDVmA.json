When you generate face ‘6’ with Chaos Dice, you invoke a Chaos Manifestation. Furthermore, you must add 1 additional Chaos Die when Channeling Power. Finally, whenever you are not standing among three or more occultists of the Slavering Maw, foes may flip the results to succeed at their Skill Tests to Resist your Magicks.</p>"
