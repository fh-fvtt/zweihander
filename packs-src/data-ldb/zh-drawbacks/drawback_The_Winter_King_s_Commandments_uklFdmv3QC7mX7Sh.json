Wolf-skins are sacred and must be worn at all times – even when in bed. Fires must be kept alight while resting, lest Abyssal spirits invade their dreams. Males will not shave their beards until defeated in combat, whereas women will wear their hair braided until they suffer the same fate. Bravery and self-reliance are the watchwords of the White Wolves."
