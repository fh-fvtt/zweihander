Your curse may have originated from an act of cruelty served upon the innocent, born from mortal sin; a dreadful stigma that has afflicted your family or a terrible Magick thatâ€™s been cast upon you. Curses of this magnitude oftentimes plague individuals until their death. Only a major sacrifice can potentially lift the curse and the cost is likely greater than you can levy. It may be that your Order or Chaos Alignment is somehow tied to the curse."
