When you generate face ‘6’ with Chaos Dice, you invoke a Chaos Manifestation. Furthermore, you must add 1 additional Chaos Die when Channeling Power. Finally, whenever you Critically Fail to cast Magick in a season other than that of your birth (as outlined under <em>Background</em> from the Character Creation chapter in <strong>ZWEIHÄNDER</strong>), you gain 6 Corruption.</p>"
