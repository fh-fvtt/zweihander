Instead of gaining Fate Points, you may opt to gain a Daemonic Gift. Aspects and Daemonic Gifts are found in <strong>Chapter 5: Liber Daemonum</strong>. When you generate face ‘6’ with Chaos Dice, you invoke a Chaos Manifestation. Furthermore, you must add 1 additional Chaos Die when Channeling Power. Finally, whenever you Critically Fail to cast Magick, you provoke Winter’s Surge - immediately roll a 1D6 Chaos Die. On a face ‘1’, you are struck numb as you are Stunned for one minute. On face ‘2-4’, your fingers grow frigid, as you must spend three times the normal amount of time (or AP if in combat) to complete casting. On face ‘5’, you are paralyzed from cold, unable to move and left Helpless for one minute. Finally, on face ‘6’, you summon a momentary winter storm, causing those within an Explosion Template to Resist with a Toughness Test or else suffer [[/r 2D10+2]] physical Peril.</p>"
