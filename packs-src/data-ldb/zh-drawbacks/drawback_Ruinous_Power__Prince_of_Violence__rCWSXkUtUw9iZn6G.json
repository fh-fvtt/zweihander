When you generate face ‘6’ with Chaos Dice, you invoke a Chaos Manifestation. Furthermore, you must add 1 additional Chaos Die when Channeling Power. Finally, you can never be affected by Magick intended to benefit you, nor can you adopt any Profession that uses Magick, ‘unlearning’ any spells or Rituals you may have known before becoming a Sanguine Legionnaire.</p>"
