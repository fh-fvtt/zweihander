They are the embodiment of justice, as holy warriors given jurisprudence by the gods above. As a reward for their virtuous ways, fate has decided that Grail Knights alone have a higher cause to serve. Of course, that ‘quest’ is more dangerous, even life-threatening than their standard duties, but with it comes glory and honor for both themselves and their order."
