They operate semi-independently of any formal church, although they do maintain a number of ‘shrine clubs’ dedicated to the god of luck. Those lucky enough to be blessed by him can call upon His powers to change the outcome of events in both minor and life-altering ways."

In addition, you automatically learn one Petty and one Lesser Magick spell from the Prayers of the Nightfather. You cannot cast Lesser Magick from the Prayers of the Nightfather until you have two Skill Ranks in Incantation. You can continue to learn Generalist Magick. Finally, you may only ever use Prayers of the Nightfather and cannot adopt any other Profession that gives different Prayer types."
