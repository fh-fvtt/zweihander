Thrashing as the Leviathanâ€™s salty brine filled your lungs, you saw the truth of the world below the water. Darkness came, and then enlightenment. Each time you were revived by the Kiss of Life, a new mystery was revealed to you. Each dream you had while dead showed you strange, terrible visions of a world that will end in deluge. You must prepare for the end times."
