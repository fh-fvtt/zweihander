        "@en": "When you are standing next to or Engaged with a person (who can also hear you), you can use your voice to compel another. By succeeding a Guile Test, you force a person to experience an emotion of your choice for a number of minutes equal to your [WB].Suggestions include anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise or trust. As the emotion is felt, choose whether they move one step up or one step down the Peril Condition Track. Once the experience of the instilled emotion has passed, the person has no memory of who compelled them to do so. Insidious Whisper can only affect Humanoids and Mutants (including player Ancestries). Finally, the same person cannot be made subject to Insidious Whisper more than once in any 24 hour period."
