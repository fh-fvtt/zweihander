        "@en": "Whenever you perform Hypnosis, the patient is also Entranced. While Entranced, the person can be commanded to take any single action you desire over the next week (e.g., quack like a duck, steal a carriage, poison your lord). Should they be commanded to undertake a dangerous task, they can attempt a Resolve Test to Resist this effect prior to taking the action. Once the action has been taken, they are no longer Entranced. Entrancement can only affect Humanoids and Mutants (including player Ancestries). Substitute Heal in place of Incantation when using Perform Hypnosis. Finally, the same person cannot be made subject to Entrancement more than once a week. Performing Hypnosis can be found in Chapter 4: Liber Alchemiae."
