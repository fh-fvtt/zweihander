By skinning these lupine predators, they can literally ‘wear’ the powers of the wolf, able to speak the tongue of canines and resist the bitter cold."

This interaction is not always beneficial: many such creatures are skittish, ignorant, confused, cunningly deceptive or even openly aggressive. This empathy acts as a supernatural type of communication; the exact nature and complexity of which is determined by the GM. In addition, while wearing the wolf skin, you never suffer the ill-effects of cold weather or Frostbite."
