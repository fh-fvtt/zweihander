In addition, you automatically learn one Petty and one Lesser Magick spell from the Prayers of the Winter King. You cannot cast Lesser Magick from the Prayers of the Winter King until you have two Skill Ranks in Incantation. You can continue to learn Generalist Magick. Finally, you may only ever use Prayers of the Winter King and cannot adopt any other Profession that gives different Prayer types."
