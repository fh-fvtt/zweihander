If successful, a number of allies equal to your [FB] may either ignore any one Critically Failed Skill Test or treat one Fury Die as a face ‘6’ without spending a Fortune Point within the next 24 hours. If you Critically Succeed, you influence a number of allies equal to three times your [FB] instead. A Character may only gain the benefit of this storytelling once per day, which takes at least an hour of time to perform."
