Once bonded, you ignore its Encumbrance Value and any negative Qualities it confers. Furthermore, it cannot be destroyed or gain the Ruined! Quality. Finally, the bonded armor does not negatively impact any Skill Tests that would normally be affected by the type you wear (e.g. swimming, sprinting, climbing, Dodging, etc.). This bond can be broken, but you must undergo the ceremony again. Your GM will outline the requirements for the ceremony."
