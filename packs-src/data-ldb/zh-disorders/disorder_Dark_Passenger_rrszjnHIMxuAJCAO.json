      "@en": "Faced with the brutal truths of the world, your wounded mind has given sanctuary to a voice that is not your own. Called the Dark Passenger, this ‘other self ’ seeks to possess you, urging you towards heinous, murderous acts. At times, you are able to ignore its demands, retaining control. At your weakest moments, the Dark Passenger becomes the driver, using your body as its vehicle for destruction.  Some who are possessed by the Dark Passenger may attempt to control these urges by abiding by a code of twisted ethics. This code may help you control its wrath with self-imposed limits as to when you kill, how you kill and who you kill. Regrettably, the code continues to lead you down the path to true insanity, as you remain possessed by unmitigated rage. The Dark Passenger will have you, both body and soul – eventually."
