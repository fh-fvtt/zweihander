      "@en": "Through spirit journeys fueled by experimentation with Deliriants, they’ve allowed you to discover other worlds beyond ours. You see where the Æthereal Veil and the Material Realm collides into beautiful, rainbow-like patterns of light. You feel a ‘oneness’ with everything, and can read the auras of others around you. You’ve spoken with not the gods, but THE god and she has revealed the truths of the world to you. Dark truths. Brutal truths. Sanguine truths! In order to see them fully- realized, everyone must helter-skelter run red; red with blood. But the colors, man... so trippy."
