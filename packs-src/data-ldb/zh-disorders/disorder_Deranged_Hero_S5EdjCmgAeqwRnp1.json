      "@en": "When the afflicted becomes a Deranged Hero, they (mistakenly) believe that they are the world’s single most important hero. Driven by an insatiable desire to help and save others, they will thrust themselves into the jaws of hell. However, this particular Disorder is always accompanied by some delirious, raving belief that they alone possess a singular power that can save others; perhaps falsely so. This power may be something along the lines of believing they can abolish the world’s currency by swallowing every gold coin they are able to earn for an honest day’s labor. It could mean that they believe that the way to end poverty for the misfortunate is to toss every coin they possess or thieve into a well and wish it so. It may even mean that they could cure disease with godly power by skinning children and wearing their tiny hands around their neck as a ‘gateway’ to divine might. Either way, these ideas from a Deranged Hero are always grandiose, inexplicable, dangerous and utterly devoid of truth."
