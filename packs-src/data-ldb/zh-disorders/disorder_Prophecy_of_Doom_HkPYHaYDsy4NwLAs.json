      "@en": "Corruption seethes within the hearts of men. Promises of power and lucre drive folk towards dark, opportunistic methods. As the corrupted manipulate the innocent, their souls twist and bend in ways not meant for mankind to do. This abandonment of faith has driven the world towards the brink, one which it may never return from. The gods have abandoned us and we have nothing to show for it but our own hedonistic ways and the weight of our sins against the world and the people within it. As for those who attempt to fight against the dying of the light, attempting to restore order from chaos? They are fighting for nothing, as everybody dies alone in the end. The world is coming to an end and thereâ€™s nothing anybody can do about it but pray to the gods for mercy to return to us. Repent and seek redemption, for the Abyss will swallow the world!"
