      "@en": "Magick is not something you merely practice, it’s something to be continuously developed. Through both success and failure, magicians have learned to hone and reshape the wild Ætheric winds to do their bidding. However, you have grown to become possessed by the idea that breaking the rules is absolutely necessary to understand the secrets of the world beyond. At every opportunity, you are strongly compelled to widen the breach between the Material Realm and the Æthereal Veil by Channeling Power. In the case of Divine Magick, only by calling to other gods and Daemons will secrets of immeasurable power be revealed to you. Only through this sublime and chaotic act can you truly become the master of Magick. And in time, you will show everyone else just what you’re capable of... even if it means unraveling reality around you."
