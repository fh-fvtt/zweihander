      "@en": "From the poorest rural hamlets to the largest of cities, Watchmen are trusted to keep a keen eye out for trouble. Trained to repel unwanted elements, to rally to the hue and cry and to act quickly when danger is detected, Watchmen patrol amongst the people and stand alone against the night. Trusted to keep the dark things out of settlements and to act as society’s moral backbone, Watchmen are thought to be an elite force with seemingly endless numbers, but the opposite is true – no more than two dozen Watchmen patrol the largest cities, and even then they are usually underequipped. Watchmen have a knack of stretching out their numbers and warning against the largest threats, but even they cannot prepare for every eventuality that may befall a city’s walls.\nWatchmen are seen as pillars of law and order, but not all Watchmen stand so tall. Rough pleasures come with rough work, for it is not uncommon to learn that a Watchman visits the illegal brothels and gaming dens that they should be policing to indulge their vices. This can lead to their being blackmailed or bribed with a few farthings and the bribes can be even bigger when a Watchman has to look the other way as an aristocrat hurriedly exits a brothel! Greasing the palms of these petty sentinels is all but part and parcel to the stench of corruption that passes in and out of the city gates."
