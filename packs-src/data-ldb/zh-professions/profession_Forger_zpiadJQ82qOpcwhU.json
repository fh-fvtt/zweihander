      "@en": "Imitation is said to be the sincerest form of flattery, so that must mean the Forger cares deeply for the people they steal from. The Forger is both an academician and con-artist, one whose job it is to professionally counterfeit seals, signatures, coins and so on. Any simple back alley filcher can clip a coin or scrawl out fraudulent handwriting, but the educated Forger treats it like the art form it deserves to be. A replicated painting from the hand of a master forger is nearly indistinguishable from the original, while a Forger’s debased coins invariably stand up to official scrutiny. The Forger has a knack of making something out of nothing, so that their ‘masterpieces’ represent nearly pure profit, even if they are actually worthless. In addition to their own work, Forgers can modify passports, replicate letters of marque, forge death certificates, and hundreds of other things. A good Forger may find themselves rubbing elbows with intellectuals and criminals alike.\\nThe Forger’s life is not an easy one though. The crime of forgery is tantamount to treason, which usually results in the Forger being sentenced to an excruciating death (being boiled alive or having the molten metal of forged coins poured down one’s throat are common forms of punishment). Forgers must stay hidden at all times lest they be ousted – for once they are found, the evidence against them is often staggering and there is little hope of a proper trial. That is why some Forgers take upon the mantle of an adventurer’s life, both to lay low and to learn new, more advanced techniques by traveling the world. Forgers are road scholars at heart – they seek out new lore and cultural touchstones in order to best hone their craft. Plus, moving from town-to-town means that they can abscond quickly should a buyer get wise to the counterfeited work. However, as the stress of living weighs down upon a Forger’s head, they soon begin to doubt what is real. It may start something simple as wondering if the newly acquired coin in their hand is legitimate, but these paranoid delusions can become so grand that a Forger will start to question the very nature of reality."
