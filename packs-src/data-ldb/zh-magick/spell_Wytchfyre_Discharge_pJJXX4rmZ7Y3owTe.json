The affected hand becomes a two-handed melee weapon with the Reach, Powerful and Slow Qualities. Instead of using your [CB], refer to your [WB] to determine Damage. Finally, whenever you strike or Parry with this discharge, refer to your Incantation Skill instead of a Combat-based Skill. You can inflict Injuries with this Magick, but foes are always left Prone instead."
