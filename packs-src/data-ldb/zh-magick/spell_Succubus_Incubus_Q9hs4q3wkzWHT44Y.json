Once invoked, you leave your physical body behind and are made Æthereal – occupying a different reality, but able to see perfectly into the Material Realm. You immediately manifest beside the named foe. You may manipulate a foe’s physical body (without being seen, heard, tasted or smelled, being felt only). At the end of each hour, the foe suffers either [[/roll 3D10]]+[WB] in Damage or 3D10+[WB] mental Peril (your choice). If your original body would be made to suffer Damage, you are instead ‘snapped’ back into your physical form and awaken, unhurt but gaining one permanent Chaos Rank. At the end of the Duration, you move a number of steps up the Damage or Peril Condition Tracks positively based on the number of steps down the Damage or Peril Condition Track your foe suffered."
