They must Resist with a successful Resolve Test or immediately begin dancing, unable to use any Actions in Combat except Reactions. Those affected by Dance with The Devil will spend their first Turn removing their clothes and armor as they dance. You must continue to play the fiddle in order to continue the spell’s Duration. Should you move one step or more down the Damage or Peril Condition Tracks negatively during this time, the spell’s Effects immediately end. You can only play the fiddle for a number of minutes equal to your [WB]."

As you play, you are caught in a spotlight of pale moonlight, even in the brightest of sunlight."
