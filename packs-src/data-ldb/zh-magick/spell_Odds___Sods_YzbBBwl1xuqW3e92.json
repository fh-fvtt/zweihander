Immediately after suffering Damage from a melee or ranged weapon, they may choose to ignore it entirely, therefore negating both Damage and any Injuries they may have suffered. However, allies must record all instances of the times they ignored Damage. Once combat ends, roll an equivalent number of Chaos Dice. If one Chaos Die results on face ‘6’, they suffer a Moderate Injury. If two Chaos Dice results on face ‘6’, they suffer a Serious Injury. If three or more Chaos Dice result in face ‘6’, they suffer a Grievous Injury."
