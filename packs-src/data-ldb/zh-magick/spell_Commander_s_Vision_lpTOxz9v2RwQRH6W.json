This place must be within a number of miles no greater than your [WB], it must be a place youâ€™ve visited before and it must be open to the sky (meaning you cannot view inside buildings or caverns). This provides total line of sight, so that you can cast Magick upon the battlefield as if you were above it. In addition, it grants a +20 Base Chance to any Warfare Tests you wish to make for the Duration of the spell. This Magick requires Concentration."
