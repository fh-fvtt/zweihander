Claws are a two-handed melee weapon with the Vicious Quality. Talons are a two-handed melee weapon with the Fast Quality. Instead of using your [CB], refer to your [WB] to determine Damage. Finally, whenever you strike or Parry with these claws or talons, refer to your Incantation Skill instead of a Combat-based Skill. You can inflict Injuries with this Magick, but your foes Bleed instead."
