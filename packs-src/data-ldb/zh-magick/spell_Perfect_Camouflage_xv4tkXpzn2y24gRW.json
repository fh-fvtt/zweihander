At any point during that time, you can choose to vanish by standing perfectly still, holding your breath. While stood still, you are completely invisible to sight. If you use any action that requires you to speak or move, the Effects of the spell are broken. You can only hold your breath for 1+[BB] minutes. If you exceed a number of minutes, you begin to suffer from Suffocation, but remain invisible until you pass out or move (after which the Effects wear off ). Regardless, the actual casting of Perfect Camouflage is apparent to none but yourself, having remained perfectly disguised throughout."
