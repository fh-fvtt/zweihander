Any Effects of Stress, Fear or Terror are instantly alleviated and any Corruption they may have suffered as a part of it is removed. Similarly, the Effects of any Disorder they may have suffered as a part of it are alleviated for a week, but the Disorder itself is not cured. Its Effects are made to go away temporarily until they flare up again. The bereaved can only be made the recipient of this Magick once a week."
