This means that if someone stole your coin purse, theyâ€™d immediately lose their purse in return. The same will happen if someone intentionally causes you to suffer Damage or Peril, they immediately suffer the same Damage or Peril in kind. It also means that if you were the target of a Perilous Stunt, the offender would immediately suffer the same in kind. This Magick lasts until it has been triggered."

Or, if they stole your purse, they lose their purse and valuables of equal value in kind. It also means that if you had been the target of one Perilous Stunt, they are immediately made the target of three Perilous Stunts in kind."
