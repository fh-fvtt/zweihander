If the person does not suffer Damage in between Turns, they temporarily suffer a -20 Base Chance to their next Skill Test and decrease their [BB] by 1. The Effects of this spell do not ‘stack’. However, a person can take advantage of this Magick for its entire Duration. If used on a foe, they may attempt to Resist the spell’s Effects with a successful Toughness Test.</p>"
