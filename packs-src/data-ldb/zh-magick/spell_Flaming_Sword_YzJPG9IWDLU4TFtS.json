The Flaming Sword provides a significant amount of heat and light, equivalent to a torch. Its flames are considered to be Moderately Dangerous. Instead of using your [CB], refer to your [WB] to determine Damage. Finally, whenever you strike or Parry with this sword, refer to your Incantation Skill instead of a Combat-based Skill. You can inflict Injuries with this Magick, but they are set On Fire instead."

It glides effortlessly back and forth, teleporting when needed, and remanifesting out of thin air as it strikes. For the Duration of the spell, roll [[/roll 1D6]] Chaos Die at the start of your Turn. If the result is face ‘1’, it will lash out at you; if the result is face ‘2-5’, the sword does nothing; and if the result is face ‘6’, it will lash out at a random ally."
