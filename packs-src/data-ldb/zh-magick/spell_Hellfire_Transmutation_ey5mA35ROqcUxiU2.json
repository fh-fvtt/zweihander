If a foe is Slain!, smoke will whorl in place where the Explosion Template occurred, obscuring those inside. Foes who are Slain! by this Magick emerge three minutes later – having turned into Adversary Demons – and attack anyone who is not you. The Adversary Demons will remain for a number of minutes equal to your [WB], until banished back to the Abyss. You are immune to the spell’s Effects."
