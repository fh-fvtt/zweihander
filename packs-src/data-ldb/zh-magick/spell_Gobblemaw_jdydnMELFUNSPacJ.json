You can move the maw a number of yards equal to 3+[WB] on your Turn for 1 AP and make a Melee Attack (1 AP). Whenever striking, your foe can attempt to Parry. As you strike, you deal [[/roll 3D10]]+[WB] in Damage. You can inflict Injuries with this Magick, but foes are caught in a Chokehold instead. This spell requires Concentration."

Those who behold this must succeed at a Resolve Test or else they suffer from Terror. In addition, you must succeed at a Toughness Test or else be immediately Slain!
