If the result is face ‘2’, they lose 2 APs on their next Turn. If the result is face ‘3’, they must spend their next Turn running in a random direction. If the result is face ‘4’, they must attack the nearest ally. If the result is face ‘5’, they cannot attack anyone, but can defend themselves. However, if the result is face ‘6’, they are left Helpless. Your foe can successfully Resist with a Scrutinize Test when this spell is cast and at the beginning of their Turn to shake off its Effects. Regardless, the actual casting of Addle-Coved is never apparent to anyone, perfectly disguised."
