Armor of this Quality does not add to Damage Threshold. Shields of this Quality cannot be used to Parry. Weapons of this Quality suffer a -3 penalty to Total Damage. Fixing Ruined! trappings require an appropriate tradesman who can fix it, who must be paid six day’s wage. Alternatively, if you can make a successful Tradecraft Test after six days of repair, you may fix it yourself. If already Ruined! trappings are once again Ruined! before they can be fixed, they are irrevocably destroyed. If you attempt to trade or sell Ruined! items, they have no value whatsoever."
