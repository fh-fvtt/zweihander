While Frenzied, they can make up to three Melee Attacks during their Turn, costing 1 AP for each Melee Attack. In addition, they can make an Opportunity Attack at the end of a Charge. However, they cannot Counterspell, Dodge or Parry while in a frenzied state. Finally, their Frenzied state makes them more susceptible to harm, as foes add an additional 1D6 Fury Die to Damage when striking the creature.|"
