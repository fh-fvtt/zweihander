Instead of suffering Injuries in this case, they instead are caught On Fire. When Slain!, they turn into mist and immediately return to their resting place to sleep. For every hour they sleep, they move one step up the Damage Condition Track positively. Once Unharmed, all Injuries are healed as well. However, while asleep, they can be permanently Slain! if an ironwood stake is driven through their heart and the head is removed."
