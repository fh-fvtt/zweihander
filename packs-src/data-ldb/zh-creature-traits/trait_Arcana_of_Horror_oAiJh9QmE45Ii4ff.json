If at least three of these creatures are standing within sight of one another, they can use Withering Touch from the Arcana of Sorcery. If at least nine of these creatures are standing within sight of one another, they can use Deathâ€™s Embrace from the Arcana of Morticism. Should a foe be Slain! by use of any of these Magicks, they are immediately turned into a Lemurian Host. Reagents are unnecessary to cast this Magick."
