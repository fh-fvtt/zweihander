Those who worship the Abyssal Prince of Decay can inflict a random Disease upon a foe when they generate a Fury Die. Those who worship the Abyssal Prince of Change can Critically Succeed at casting one Petty, Lesser and Greater Magick without having to make an Incantation Test. Those who worship the Abyssal Prince of Pleasure can use their Possession ability to control a foe for hours, instead of minutes. Those who worship the Abyssal Prince of Violence add a 1D6 Fury Die to all Damage they do, regardless of whether it is from weapons or Magick."
