While Confused, they must roll 1D6 Chaos Die as their Turn starts. If the result is face ‘1‘, they lose 1 AP on this Turn. If the result is face ‘2‘, they lose 2 APs on this Turn. If the result is face ‘3‘, they elect to run in a random direction. If the result is face ‘4‘, they elect to attack the nearest ally. If the result is face ‘5‘, they do nothing. However, if the result is face ‘6’, they are left Helpless. Once subject to one of these effects, they can attempt to Resist at the beginning of their Turn to shake it off. Foes who attempt to Resist mustflip the results to fail their Skill Test.|"
