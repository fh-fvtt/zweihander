However, the Disease spreads rapidly, as every Turn they spend in the Burst Template they immediately (and permanently) lose 9% Agility as if three weeks had passed. In addition, those in the Whorl cannot use ranged weapons (or by struck by them). Foes cannot be infected with Bubonic Whorl again until at least a day has passed.
