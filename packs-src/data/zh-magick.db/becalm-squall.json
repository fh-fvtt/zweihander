The winds buffet outside of the area, but provide only a gentle breeze upon the boat. An area of calm radiates around the boat a number of yards equal to your [WB], allowing companion boats to take advantage of the Magick. If becalmed, the boat moves as if it were guided by a gentle wind and the thrashing waters no longer impede its ability to navigate."
