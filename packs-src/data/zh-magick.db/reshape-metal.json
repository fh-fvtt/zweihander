For instance, you could reshape a door into a sled, a lead flagon into a fishing lure or a sword into a dirk. The object being changed must be larger than the new object, although you can reshape objects into similarly-shaped or sized objects. In addition, it cannot change the properties of the metal (meaning you could not turn a lead ball into a gold coin). If you attempt to use this on a foe’s armor, they can avoid it with a successful Coordination Test as the metal reshapes. Otherwise, they are knocked Prone."
