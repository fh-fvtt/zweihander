        "@en": "Whenever a Character you can see clearly takes their Turn, you may make a Scrutinize Test as a Reaction for 1 AP. By succeeding a Scrutinize Test, the person you see is Disrupted, and you command them to take any Action In Combat (but it must be a 1 AP action). Should your Disruption cause them to bring harm to their allies, they can attempt a Resolve Test to Resist this effect. Disruption can only affect Humanoids and Mutants (including player Ancestries). You can use this ability outside of combat, but the action you declare cannot exceeds 10 seconds of time to complete it. Finally, the same person cannot be made subject to Disruption more than once in any 24 hour period."
