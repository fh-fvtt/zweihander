Unlike Damage done during combat, you do not suffer Injuries from this Damage, but you can enact a Blood Oath against a single foe whose real name you know (or True Name for creatures who are Abyssal or Supernatural). Whenever you use Fury Dice to determine weapon Damage against this foe, they explode on face ‘1’ or ‘6’. You can enact another Blood Oath once the current one is completed by the person being Slain!."
