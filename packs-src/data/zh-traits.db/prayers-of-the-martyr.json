      "@en": "Although the Martyr is a very popular goddess, her followers do not preach actively. They merely serve as compassionate volunteers to those truly in need. Water is sacred to every Revered Mother, and is often used to consecrate the thresholds of doors that have been transgressed against by violent people, or used to bless the wounded. Her prayers are of healing and mercy."

You cannot cast Lesser Magick from the Prayers of the Martyr until you have two Skill Ranks in Incantation. You can continue to learn Generalist Magick. Finally, you may only ever use Prayers of the Martyr and cannot adopt any other Profession that gives different Prayer types."
