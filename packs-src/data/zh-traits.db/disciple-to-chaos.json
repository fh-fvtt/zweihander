Whenever you Critically Succeed at the Skill Test to strike, your foes also suffer Chaotic Rot;\n   As an occultist to the Prince of Pleasure, foes who are Engaged with you are enraptured by your hypnotic musk and cannot add their Apprentice or Journeyman Skill Ranks to Combat and Willpower-based Skill Tests;\n   As an occultist to the Prince of Violence, when you deal Damage to a foe using a melee weapon with the Punishing or Vicious Quality, they begin to Bleed;\n   As an occultist to the Outsider, when fighting against occultists of the other four Abyssal Princes, you add an additional 1D6 Fury Die to Damage and automatically succeed at Resolve Tests."
