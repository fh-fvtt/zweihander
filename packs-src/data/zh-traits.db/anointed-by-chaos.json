This follows many of the same rules as Channeling Power to cast Magick, but with these specific requirements: you must have a weapon in-hand, you must be able to see and speak and a phial of sacred oil must be poured onto the weapon. This sacred oil is determined by your GM, based on the weapon you intend to bedevil with chaotic might.\n  You may Channel Power up to three steps. However, if you generate one face ‘6’, you invoke a Petty Manifestation. If you roll two face ‘6s’, you invoke a Lesser Manifestation and if three or more face ‘6s’, you invoke a Greater Manifestation. Furthermore, if a Chaos Manifestation\n  inflicts any sort of negative effects upon you to Cast Magick, apply them instead to your Combat-based Skill Tests. The GM will change the effects of the table to best match\n  the mechanical results."
