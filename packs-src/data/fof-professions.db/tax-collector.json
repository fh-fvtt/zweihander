      "@en": "<p>It&rsquo;s no secret. I am one of the most hated people in the cities. Ever since the Stamp Act passed, I have been spat on and had stones thrown at me by Rebels and Loyalists alike. I serve an essential purpose, though: taxes help pay for roadways, ports, imported commodities and the army. It&rsquo;s not my fault my superiors passed these laws; I&rsquo;m just doing my job when I come to collect. However, I grow weary with the daily insults and the fact that I must always watch my back to prevent being assaulted or worse.</p>\n<p>The more tax is squeezed from the people, the angrier they get&mdash;it&rsquo;s inevitable at this point that a conflict will break out. Many are misplacing their anger, though, attacking quill-pushers like myself who have no real power in these deliberations. This anger will soon turn to bloodshed, and I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if my fellow collectors are the first to be tarred and feathered.</p>"
