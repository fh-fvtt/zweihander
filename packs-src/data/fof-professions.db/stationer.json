      "@en": "<p>I am a purveyor of fine books, broad-sheets, literature and other works of the printed arts. I sow and harvest the seeds of knowledge and aid in ridding the world of ignorance. I sell other trifles beyond books&mdash; parchment, paper, quills and ink&mdash;but my primary income comes from the written word. I provide texts from Europe, the east and even local authors of note. My clientele is devoted, continually hungering for the newest journals, magazines and newspapers hot off the presses, here and in England. My calling is to help spread the beauty of the written word to all, rich and poor.</p>\n<p>Not all the books I procure are common&mdash;I also have questionable texts that cover topics both esoteric and profane: occult codices, lost religious treatises, even mystical tomes that date back to the most ancient times. In my spare time, I have read many of these hermetic books, and they mention many disturbing things involving foul creatures and the coming darkness. The more I read, the more I notice patterns&mdash;not just within the text, but with events and rumors I hear from my patrons. Could these grimoires be more than philosophical meditations?</p>"
