      "@en": "<p>I am considered by many to be a coward. I broke a commitment to fight for my country, be it on land or if by sea. I am not a coward, very far from it, to be exact&mdash;I am a realist. War never changes, and with it comes the highest cost of all: one&rsquo;s life. I am by no means a pacifist or a scared child, but I know a fool&rsquo;s gambit when I see one. The only people who win at war are great and powerful, and I am neither&mdash;so I slipped away with a clear conscience.</p>\n<p>The world is in turmoil and opinions are mixed. On one side, I have those who are calling for rebellion and tossing off the yoke of tyranny. On the other side, I have those who see the pointlessness of rebelling and instead search for a way to find common ground. I know what is coming&mdash;a fight. Like all fights, soldiers will be needed, not for philosophizing, but to be tossed into the machine of war only to be spat back out, changed forever, or worse. No matter what happens, I refuse to be one of those numbers.</p>"
