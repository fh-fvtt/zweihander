Instead of gaining Fate Points, you may opt to gain a Daemonic Gift. Aspects and Daemonic Gifts are found in Chapter 6: Liber Umbrarum. When you generate face ‘6’ with Chaos Dice, you invoke a Chaos Manifestation. Furthermore, you must add 1 additional Chaos Die when Channeling Power. Finally, you must eat three meals a day or else suffer from Starvation (as outlined under Starvation from the Hazards & Healing chapter in ZWEIHÄNDER)."
